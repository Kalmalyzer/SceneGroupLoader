# SceneGroupLoader
Standardized logic for asynchronous loading/unloading of groups of Unity scenes

This provides a common way of loading/activating/unloading a group of scenes.
It restricts what can be done when to avoid potential deadlocks with the Unity APIs.

There is an example available at https://github.com/Kalmalyzer/SceneGroupLoader-Example
